# The Emulator Project
Welcome to the Emulator Project by R. v.d. Bogaard

## Description
I have always been wanting to help out emulator projects ever since 2008, but I never had the time to study for it till now. I've already written a CHIP-8 emulator based on opensource material and I'm currently learning/working on both a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) & Nintendo Gameboy.

As of now you these systems will be emulated in Unity3D on a virtual screen with normal pc/gamepad interactions. The plan is to incorporate Virtual Reality for a more interactive experience.
